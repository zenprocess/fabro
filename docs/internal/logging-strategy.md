# Fabro Logging Strategy

Fabro uses the `tracing` crate for structured logging. CLI logs write to `~/.fabro/logs/cli.YYYY-MM-DD.log`, rotated daily by `tracing-appender`; logs older than 7 days are cleaned up on startup. Daemonized server starts write one main log at `<storage>/logs/server.log` by default. Foreground server starts (`fabro server start --foreground` and `fabro server restart --foreground`) stream server logs to stdout by default when `[server.logging].destination` is absent. Interactive foreground stdout uses a compact colored one-line format with local date-bearing timestamps (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm`); piped stdout and file logs keep the plain tracing format with ANSI disabled. Set `[server.logging].destination = "file"` to force file logging, or `FABRO_LOG_DESTINATION=stdout` to force stdout where compatible. Default install-generated `settings.toml` intentionally omits `[server.logging].destination` so foreground mode can use its stdout default.

Each worker also writes its tracing events to the run-scoped log at `<scratch>/runtime/server.log`. This per-run file is worker tracing only: parent-side scheduling/cancel/delete events stay in the main server log, and unstructured worker stderr is still drained by the parent into `<storage>/logs/server.log`.

Log level is controlled by the `FABRO_LOG` env var (default: `info`). Server `[server.logging] level = "debug"` is propagated to worker subprocesses when `FABRO_LOG` is not already set in the parent process. Logs are for **developers debugging issues after the fact** — they are not user-facing output.

Production runs at INFO level. INFO should be low-volume and high-signal — the summary of what happened. When something goes wrong, developers enable `FABRO_LOG=debug` to get the full picture. DEBUG can be as verbose as needed since it's only turned on temporarily.

## File Appenders

Fixed server and per-run logs use a per-event-buffered writer opened with `O_APPEND`. Each tracing event buffers formatting writes in memory, then flushes that event to the shared file under a mutex with one `write_all()` call. This is intended to keep normal tracing-sized lines contiguous across concurrent tasks and worker processes; tests validate the event-size range used by Fabro, but the code does not claim a strict syscall-level atomicity guarantee for all possible filesystems and buffer sizes.

## When to Log

**Log at INFO (always on in production):**

- Lifecycle boundaries of top-level operations — session started/completed, pipeline started/completed, server ready
- Failures and warnings — every error/warn path, with enough context to diagnose the cause
- Keep it sparse: a typical agent session should produce ~5-10 INFO lines

**Log at DEBUG (enabled on-demand for investigation):**

- Individual steps within an operation — each LLM request, each tool call, each pipeline node
- External interactions with detail — request parameters, response metadata, token counts
- Decision points — why a code path was taken (retry triggered, fallback used, config value resolved)
- State changes and intermediate results — config resolution, parsing outcomes

**Do not log:**

- Hot loops or per-token streaming events (use DEBUG only if truly needed for diagnosis)
- Data that belongs in user-facing output (`eprintln!` for interactive CLI feedback, not tracing)
- Detached user-visible warnings or errors that need to survive `attach`/`events` (`detach.log` is debug-only; emit an `Event` into the run event stream instead)
- Redundant information already captured by a parent event (if you logged "starting X", you don't need to log every sub-step at the same level)
- Events that are already traced via `EventEnum::trace()` — the event enums (`AgentEvent`, `PipelineEvent`, `ExecutionEnvEvent`) each have a `trace()` method called automatically at their emit site; do not add manual `info!`/`debug!` calls that duplicate what `trace()` already emits
- Wrapper/forwarding variants that re-emit an inner event — `PipelineEvent::Agent`, `PipelineEvent::ExecutionEnv`, and `AgentEvent::SubAgentEvent` are no-ops in `trace()` because the inner event is already traced at its origin
- Secrets, API keys, or auth tokens — even at DEBUG level

## Log Levels

### ERROR — Something failed and the operation cannot continue

The current operation is aborting. A human reviewing logs should investigate every ERROR.

```rust
error!(server = %name, error = %err, "MCP server failed to start");
error!(provider = %provider, status = %status, "LLM request failed after all retries");
```

### WARN — Something unexpected happened but execution continues

Degraded behavior, fallback paths, or conditions that might indicate a problem.

```rust
warn!(server = %name, "MCP server disconnected, removing tools");
warn!(attempt = attempt, max = max_retries, error = %err, "LLM request failed, retrying");
```

### INFO — The production log level

INFO is always on. It should tell you **what** happened at a high level: which operations started, which completed, and key outcomes. Think of INFO as the audit trail — enough to answer "what did the system do?" but not so much that it creates noise. A typical agent session should produce a handful of INFO lines, not hundreds.

```rust
info!(model = %model, "Starting agent session");
info!(server = %name, tools = tool_count, "MCP server ready");
info!(pipeline = %name, "Pipeline complete");
info!(turns = turn_count, tool_calls = tool_call_count, "Agent session complete");
```

### DEBUG — Turn this on when something goes wrong

DEBUG is off in production by default. Enable it with `FABRO_LOG=debug` to investigate a specific issue. DEBUG events provide the **how** and **why**: request/response details, intermediate state, config resolution, individual steps within a larger operation. DEBUG can be verbose — that's fine, since it's only enabled temporarily.

```rust
debug!(model = %model, messages = msg_count, tools = tool_count, "Sending LLM request");
debug!(provider = %provider, input_tokens = input, output_tokens = output, "LLM response received");
debug!(tool = %name, duration_ms = elapsed, "Tool call complete");
debug!(path = %path.display(), "Loading workflow file");
debug!(env_var = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "API key resolved from environment");
```

## How to Write a Log Event

### Message: describe what happened

The message string is a short, human-readable description. Use sentence fragments starting with a verb or noun. No variable interpolation in the message — put variable data in structured fields.

```rust
// Good — message is a fixed string, data is in fields
info!(server = %name, tools = tool_count, "MCP server ready");

// Bad — variable data interpolated into message string
info!("MCP server '{}' ready with {} tools", name, tool_count);
```

Fixed message strings make logs grepable and let tooling aggregate events by message.

### Fields: attach structured context

Fields are key-value pairs that make events queryable. Include enough context that the event is useful on its own without reading surrounding log lines.

**Field naming:**
- Use `snake_case` for field names
- Use consistent names across the codebase (see table below)
- Keep names short but unambiguous

**Common field names:**

| Field | Used for |
|-------|----------|
| `model` | LLM model identifier |
| `provider` | LLM provider name (anthropic, openai, gemini) |
| `server` | MCP server name |
| `tool` | Tool name being called |
| `turn` | Agent turn number |
| `attempt` | Retry attempt number |
| `error` | Error value on failure |
| `path` | File system path |
| `duration_ms` | Elapsed time in milliseconds |
| `principal_kind` | HTTP caller category (`user`, `worker`, `webhook`, `none`, etc.) |
| `auth_status` | HTTP authentication result (`missing`, `invalid`, `expired`, `authenticated`) |
| `idp_issuer`, `idp_subject` | Canonical user identity for authenticated user requests |

For HTTP request logs, use the request `Principal` projection rather than hand-assembled auth strings. User identity fields are present only for `Principal::User`; worker and webhook requests use their variant-specific fields (`run_id`, `delivery_id`).

Server auth intentionally exposes a mutable `RequestAuth` context slot for public auth routes and guard extractors such as `RequiredUser` / `RequireRunScoped` for protected routes. There is no loose `RequestPrincipal` extractor; route-facing extractors should enforce the route's auth contract while the slot supplies the final HTTP log fields.
| `input_tokens` | Token count for LLM input |
| `output_tokens` | Token count for LLM output |

**Field format specifiers:**
- `%` (Display) for user-readable values: `server = %name`, `error = %err`, `path = %path.display()`
- `?` (Debug) for internal/enum values: `level = ?params.level`, `status = ?response.status`
- No specifier for primitives: `tools = tool_count`, `attempt = 3`

### Examples by crate

**fabro-agent:**
```rust
info!(model = %model, "Starting agent session");
info!(turns = turn_count, tool_calls = total_calls, "Agent session complete");
debug!(turn = turn_number, "Starting agent turn");
debug!(tool = %name, "Executing tool call");
debug!(tool = %name, duration_ms = elapsed, "Tool call complete");
warn!(tool = %name, error = %err, "Tool execution failed");
```

**fabro-llm:**
```rust
debug!(provider = %provider, model = %model, messages = count, "Sending LLM request");
debug!(provider = %provider, model = %model, input_tokens = input, output_tokens = output, "LLM response received");
warn!(provider = %provider, attempt = n, error = %err, "Request failed, retrying");
error!(provider = %provider, error = %err, "Request failed after all retries");
```

**fabro-workflow:**
```rust
info!(pipeline = %name, "Starting pipeline execution");
info!(pipeline = %name, nodes = count, "Pipeline complete");
debug!(node = %id, handler = %handler_type, "Executing pipeline node");
debug!(node = %id, duration_ms = elapsed, "Pipeline node complete");
```

**fabro-mcp:**
```rust
info!(server = %name, tools = tool_count, "MCP server ready");
debug!(server = %name, transport = %transport_type, "Connecting to MCP server");
error!(server = %name, error = %err, "MCP server failed to start");
```

## Cross-Package Guidelines

Every crate that does meaningful work should emit tracing events. The `tracing` dependency is workspace-level — add it to any crate's `Cargo.toml` with:

```toml
tracing.workspace = true
```

The subscriber is initialized once in `fabro-cli`. Library crates (`fabro-agent`, `fabro-llm`, etc.) only emit events — they never configure the subscriber. This means:

- Library crates import `tracing::{info, debug, warn, error}` and call the macros
- The events go nowhere in unit tests (this is fine — tests verify behavior, not log output)
- The events are captured by whatever subscriber the binary sets up

When adding tracing to a new crate, start with the boundaries: INFO for the start/end of top-level operations, DEBUG for the individual steps within them. When in doubt about the level, use DEBUG — it's easy to promote something to INFO later, but hard to demote a noisy INFO event without breaking someone's log monitoring.

## Event Enum Tracing

The domain event enums (`AgentEvent`, `PipelineEvent`, `ExecutionEnvEvent`) each implement a `pub fn trace(&self)` method (or `trace(&self, session_id: &str)` for `AgentEvent`) that emits a structured tracing log line per variant. This method is called automatically from each enum's emit site, so every emitted event produces a log line without any additional code at the call site.

**Rules for event tracing:**

- **Add tracing for new variants** by adding a match arm in the enum's `trace()` method. Choose the level based on the guidelines above (INFO for lifecycle boundaries, DEBUG for individual steps, WARN/ERROR for failures).
- **Do not add manual log calls at emit sites.** The `trace()` call in the emitter handles it. Adding `info!` or `debug!` next to an `emit()` call will double-log.
- **Detached UX belongs in events, not stderr.** If an attached user needs to see the message later via `fabro attach` or `fabro events`, emit a workflow event (for example `RunNotice`) and let tracing capture the developer-oriented copy separately.
- **Wrapper variants are no-ops.** When one event enum wraps another (`PipelineEvent::Agent` wraps `AgentEvent`, `AgentEvent::SubAgentEvent` wraps a child `AgentEvent`), the wrapper's `trace()` arm is `{}` because the inner event was already traced at its origin. This prevents double-logging.
- **Streaming noise variants are no-ops.** `TextDelta` and `ToolCallOutputDelta` produce no log output — per-token events would flood the logs even at DEBUG level.

## Prohibited Fields

Some field values carry real or latent sensitivity and must not appear in `tracing` events under any level. When the underlying information is genuinely useful for observability, emit a cardinality-bounded summary (count, size, truncation flag) instead of the raw value.

| Field | Why it's prohibited | Emit instead |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| `diff_contents` | File contents from a user workspace may include secrets, PII, or copyrighted code. | `bytes_total`, `file_count`, `truncated` counters |
| `file_path` (for changed-file paths in the Run Files endpoint specifically) | Leaks workspace structure; combined with public run IDs can expose layout of private repos. | `file_count`, aggregate counts bucketed by `binary`, `sensitive`, `symlink`, `submodule` |
| `git_stderr` | Raw git output for untrusted workspaces may include path-shaped secrets (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa_work`) and terminal control sequences. | A short categorized reason (`"timeout"`, `"bad_revision"`, `"unknown_object"`) derived from stderr, never the stderr itself |
| Raw command stdout/stderr, including raw `git_stderr` | Process output for untrusted workspaces may include secrets, PII, paths, or terminal control sequences. | Use `ExecOutputTail`, which is sanitized, redacted, and tail-truncated before serialization or tracing. |
| Credential-ish strings (`api_key`, `bearer_token`, `cookie`, `session_id`, …) | Exfiltration risk. | Emit `has_credentials: true` or a fingerprint (`token_last4`) only when debugging is the only option |

These prohibitions apply to every level (ERROR through TRACE). If an error path genuinely needs raw output for triage, route it through an authenticated support channel — not the default tracing subscriber. The redacted, sanitized, tail-truncated `ExecOutputTail` form is permitted in tracing because that redaction layer is the safety boundary; never log the raw `ExecResult` streams directly.

Safe event tracing for process failures should include bounded metadata when the structured tail is already present on the event:

```rust
error!(
    command,
    exit_code,
    exec_output_tail_present,
    exec_stdout_tail_bytes,
    exec_stdout_truncated,
    exec_stderr_tail_bytes,
    exec_stderr_truncated,
    "Setup command failed"
);
```

When logging a caught error that may wrap a sandbox `exec_command` failure, render it with `fabro_sandbox::display_for_log(&err)`. That preserves the normal cause chain and appends the redacted `ExecOutputTail` when one is present.

For URLs that may carry credentials, log `fabro_redact::DisplaySafeUrl` or a string produced by `DisplaySafeUrl::redacted_string()`. Its `Display` and `Debug` forms redact userinfo plus these query keys case-insensitively: `token`, `install_token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `api_key`, `apikey`, `code`, `state`, `password`, `secret`, and `key`. Raw URL strings stay reserved for wire transit, subprocess arguments, redirects, and persistence.
