Goal: # Unified Agent Transcript Events Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` or `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Make the ordered Fabro event stream sufficient to recreate an API-mode agent session without adding a parallel transcript event family.

**Architecture:** Extend existing `agent.message`, `agent.tool.started`, and `agent.tool.completed` event semantics. Messages are communication (`system`, `user`, `reasoning`, `agent`). Tool calls and tool results are actions, not messages. Persist only committed events; partial stream deltas, retries, and interrupted output are not replay sources.

**Out of scope:** Request metadata, compaction semantics, and broad store refactors.

---

## Key Decisions

- Use one shared Fabro transcript model in `fabro-types`; do not create parallel DTOs for events, API, store projection, and runtime history.
- Treat reasoning as a first-class message kind, not a tool call and not part of the visible agent answer.
- Keep model-role semantics (`kind`) separate from audit/source semantics (`source`).
- Keep tool calls/results as enriched action lifecycle records.
- Use event `seq` as the ordering source of truth.
- Keep run/session lifecycle events for lifecycle only; transcript replay comes from `agent.message` and `agent.tool.*`.
- Preserve provider replay payloads as structured parts, not strings.

## Type Ownership

Promote provider-neutral replay primitives from `fabro-llm` into `fabro-types`, then make `fabro-llm` import or re-export the canonical types.

Canonical shared types:

- `ContentPart`
- `ThinkingData`
- `ToolCall`
- `ToolResult`
- `TranscriptMessage`
- `MessageKind`
- `MessageSource`
- `PairMessageRef`
- existing `Principal` for actor attribution

Name the durable transcript type `TranscriptMessage`, not bare `Message`, to avoid import ambiguity with `fabro_agent::Message` and `fabro_llm::types::Message`. Do not add `AgentTranscriptPart` as a second `{ kind, data }` model if `ContentPart` can own the role. Event props must embed the canonical `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, and `ContentPart` types directly. OpenAPI replacements should point generated API types at these canonical Rust types and include type identity / JSON parity tests.

## Interface Changes

Add shared transcript types in `fabro-types`:

```rust
TranscriptMessage {
    id,
    turn_id,
    kind,   // system | user | reasoning | agent
    source, // system_prompt | turn_input | followup | steer | pair | injected_system | injected_user | loop_detection
    actor: Option<Principal>,
    pair: Option<PairMessageRef>,
    content: Vec<ContentPart>,
    provider,
    model,
    response_id,
    usage,
}

PairMessageRef {
    pair_id,
    message_id,
    client_message_id,
}
```

`kind` captures provider/model-role semantics for replay. `source` captures audit/UI origin. Steering is a source, not a role: steering that currently replays to the LLM as user-role input must be stored as `kind=user, source=steer`.

Extend existing durable events:

- `agent.message`
  - Add `message: TranscriptMessage`.
  - This becomes the canonical replay source for committed system, user, reasoning, and agent messages.
  - Keep narrow `text`, `model`, `billing`, and `tool_call_count` fields until web/server/client consumers are migrated.
- `agent.tool.started`
  - Add `tool_call: ToolCall`.
  - Add `turn_id` and `parent_message_id`.
  - Keep narrow `tool_name`, `tool_call_id`, and `arguments` fields until consumers are migrated.
- `agent.tool.completed`
  - Add `tool_result: ToolResult`.
  - Add `turn_id`.
  - Keep narrow `tool_name`, `tool_call_id`, `output`, and `is_error` fields until consumers are migrated.

Provider replay requirements:

- OpenAI `openai_reasoning` and `openai_message` opaque items remain exact `ContentPart::Other` payloads.
- Anthropic thinking and redacted thinking remain `ContentPart::Thinking` payloads with signatures preserved.
- Gemini `thoughtSignature` remains `ToolCall.provider_metadata`.
- Reasoning messages can contain cleartext, redacted, signed, encrypted, or opaque provider parts, but implementation must not collapse these into plain strings.

Identity requirements:

- Add a canonical `MessageId` in `fabro-types`.
- `fabro-agent::Session` mints a `TurnId` for every `run_single_input()` invocation unless the caller supplies one.
- Ask Fabro passes its existing API `TurnId` into the agent session before processing.
- Workflow API-mode stages let the agent session mint a `TurnId`.
- The assistant/agent message id is minted before emitting tool calls. Tool calls emitted from that response use `parent_message_id = agent_message.id`.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Add Typed Event Contracts

Modify:

- `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/agent.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/session.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/mod.rs`
- `docs/public/api-reference/fabro-api.yaml` if exposed wire shapes change

Tasks:

- Move or re-home provider-neutral `ContentPart`, `ThinkingData`, `ToolCall`, and `ToolResult` into `fabro-types`.
- Add canonical `TranscriptMessage`, `MessageKind`, `MessageSource`, and `PairMessageRef` types in `fabro-types`.
- Extend `AgentMessageProps` to carry the canonical message payload.
- Extend tool started/completed props to carry canonical tool call/result payloads plus turn/message linkage.
- Keep serde defaults where needed so old event payloads continue to deserialize.
- Add `fabro-api` replacement tests for type identity and JSON parity when OpenAPI schemas map to canonical Rust types.

### 2. Emit Committed Messages From `fabro-agent`

Modify:

- `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/types.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/session.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/history.rs`

Tasks:

- Replace or extend the narrow assistant-only `AgentEvent::AssistantMessage` path with a general committed `AgentEvent::Message`.
- Emit `kind=system, source=system_prompt` after the exact rendered system prompt is assembled.
- Emit `kind=user, source=turn_input` after skill expansion/wrapping, using the exact user message sent to the model.
- Emit `kind=user, source=followup` for follow-up inputs.
- Emit `kind=user, source=steer` for steering-as-user.
- Emit `kind=user, source=loop_detection` for loop-detection steering.
- Emit `kind=system, source=injected_system` for injected system messages.
- Emit `kind=user, source=injected_user` for injected user-role messages.
- Emit `kind=user, source=pair` for pair chat messages that enter LLM history, with `pair` populated.
- Emit `kind=system, source=pair` for pair join/leave or other pair system messages that enter LLM history, with `pair` populated.
- Emit `kind=reasoning` only for completed provider reasoning blocks that must be preserved for replay, preserving exact structured parts.
- Emit `kind=agent` after provider `Finish`, using the completed response content.
- Do not emit committed messages for deltas, retries, or interrupted partial output.
- Ensure all message events carry `turn_id`, `source`, and optional `actor`/`pair` metadata where applicable.

### 3. Enrich Tool Action Events

Modify:

- `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/session.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/tool_execution.rs`
- provider adapters only where extra metadata is not currently surfaced

Tasks:

- Preserve `ToolCall.tool_type`, `raw_arguments`, and `provider_metadata`.
- Preserve `ToolResult` structured output, error state, and supported media/artifact fields.
- Link every tool call to the owning agent message with `parent_message_id`.
- Mint the agent message id before tool execution so tool events can link correctly.
- Keep tool calls/results out of message events.

### 4. Persist Unified Events In Both API Paths

Modify:

- `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/handler/llm/api.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/convert.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/names.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/server/handler/sessions.rs`

Tasks:

- Convert the unified agent message event through the existing workflow `Event::Agent` path.
- Convert Ask Fabro/server session agent events into the same durable `agent.message` and `agent.tool.*` shapes.
- Keep `run.session.created`, `run.session.turn.started`, and terminal turn events as lifecycle events.
- Keep old `run.session.user_message`, `run.session.assistant_message`, and `run.session.tool_call.*` projection support until all producers and consumers are migrated.
- Prefer a shared event persistence helper for workflow and server session paths so redaction behavior is consistent.
- Avoid creating new transcript-specific event families.

Migration order:

1. Add canonical types and event deserialization support.
2. Update projection to read both old narrow run-session events and new unified agent events.
3. Switch workflow and Ask Fabro producers to emit unified events while retaining compatibility fields.
4. Update web/server/client consumers to prefer unified payloads with narrow-field fallback.
5. Only then consider deprecating narrow transcript-bearing run-session events.

### 5. Define Pair Transcript Relationship

Modify:

- `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/steering_hub.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/pair.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/server/handler/sessions.rs`
- web consumers of pair transcript events

Tasks:

- Treat `agent.pair.user_message` and `agent.pair.system_message` as UI/audit projection events only.
- Do not use pair transcript events as replay-authoritative session history.
- For any pair message that affects LLM history, emit the corresponding canonical `agent.message` event with `source=pair` and a populated `PairMessageRef`.
- Store pair user chat as `kind=user, source=pair`.
- Store pair join/leave or other pair system items that enter model context as `kind=system, source=pair`.
- Keep existing pair API transcript types as projections over pair events and canonical message references, not as a second replay model.

### 6. Rebuild Session Projection From Events

Modify:

- `lib/crates/fabro-store/src/run_sessions.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/session.rs`
- `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/history.rs`

Tasks:

- Project runtime context from ordered `agent.message` and `agent.tool.*` events scoped by envelope `session_id`.
- Preserve provider-specific reasoning, opaque provider items, response ids, usage, and tool metadata.
- Keep best-effort fallback projection for legacy narrow session events.
- Ignore pair transcript events for replay except as a legacy fallback path; canonical `agent.message` with `source=pair` is the replay source.
- Ensure `Session::from_record()` can hydrate without dropping provider parts needed for same-provider replay.
- Preserve injected history sources: rendered system prompt, wrapped user input, follow-up input, steering, injected system messages, injected user-role messages, and loop-detection steering.

### 7. Redaction And Security Policy

Modify:

- workflow event persistence path
- server session event persistence path
- event redaction utilities

Tasks:

- Define raw replay fields explicitly: provider opaque parts, raw tool arguments, provider metadata, and structured tool outputs.
- Apply one shared redaction policy before durable storage for both workflow and server sessions.
- Preserve replay-critical opaque provider fields unless they match an existing secret redaction rule.
- Do not omit fields needed for same-provider replay silently; if a field must be redacted, preserve the shape and mark the value redacted.
- Add tests covering raw tool arguments and provider metadata through both persistence paths.

### 8. Consumer Compatibility

Modify:

- web event consumers that currently read narrow `properties.text`
- web pair transcript consumers that read `agent.pair.*`
- server/API projections that expose session detail or event detail
- generated clients if OpenAPI changes

Tasks:

- Keep narrow compatibility fields in emitted events until consumers are updated.
- Update consumers to prefer `properties.message` and fall back to narrow fields.
- Keep pair transcript rendering backed by pair projection events, while ensuring session replay and hydration consume canonical `agent.message` events.
- Add web/server tests that render both old and new event shapes.
- Document the deprecation path for narrow transcript fields after consumer migration.

## Test Plan

- `fabro-types`: serde round trips for `agent.message`, enriched `agent.tool.started`, and enriched `agent.tool.completed`.
- Type ownership:
  - canonical `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, `ContentPart`, `TranscriptMessage`, usage, and event prop types are reused rather than duplicated
  - OpenAPI replacement tests prove type identity and JSON parity where API schemas expose these shapes
- `fabro-agent`: committed system/user/reasoning/agent messages emit once, while partial deltas and interrupted streams do not create committed messages.
- `fabro-agent`: followups, steering-as-user, injected system messages, and loop-detection steering emit committed messages with the correct `kind`, `source`, and `turn_id`.
- Role/source mapping:
  - steering-as-user emits `kind=user, source=steer`
  - loop-detection steering emits `kind=user, source=loop_detection`
  - injected user-role messages emit `kind=user, source=injected_user`
  - pair user chat emits `kind=user, source=pair` with `PairMessageRef`
  - pair join/leave context emits `kind=system, source=pair` with `PairMessageRef`
- Identity/linkage: tool calls include the parent agent message id minted before tool execution.
- Provider replay:
  - OpenAI encrypted reasoning and opaque message items survive event replay.
  - Anthropic thinking signatures survive event replay.
  - Gemini thought signatures survive enriched tool call replay.
- `fabro-store`: session projection from event `seq` order recreates runtime history including provider parts and tool metadata.
- Pair projection: pair transcript events render in the pair UI/audit surface but do not create duplicate replay history when the canonical `source=pair` message exists.
- Migration: old narrow run-session events and new unified events both hydrate session detail without duplicate transcript entries.
- `fabro-server`: Ask Fabro stores the wrapped model input, not only the raw UI question.
- Redaction: workflow and server session persistence apply the same redaction behavior to raw arguments, provider metadata, and tool outputs.
- Consumer compatibility: existing UI/server consumers render old narrow fields and new unified message payloads.
- API conformance: OpenAPI-generated Rust/TypeScript clients still match the spec after schema updates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A completed API-mode session can be reconstructed from the event stream without losing committed system, user, reasoning, agent, tool call, or tool result state.
- New transcript state is stored through existing semantic events, not a separate transcript event family.
- Tool calls remain actions, not messages.
- Partial output remains non-authoritative for replay.
- The implementation introduces one canonical set of replay types, not duplicated event/API/runtime DTOs.
- Steering, pair, and injected inputs preserve provider-role semantics in `kind` and audit/source semantics in `source`.
- Pair transcript events are UI/audit projection events, not a replay-authoritative transcript source.
- Ask Fabro migration is backward compatible for existing session events and projections.

# Simplify: Code Review and Cleanup

Review changes vs. origin for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Fix any issues found.

## Phase 1: Identify Changes

Run git diff (or git diff HEAD if there are staged changes) to see what changed. If there are no git changes, review the most recently modified files that the user mentioned or that you edited earlier in this conversation.

## Phase 2: Launch Three Review Agents in Parallel

Use the Agent tool to launch all three agents concurrently in a single message. Pass each agent the full diff so it has the complete context.

### Agent 1: Code Reuse Review

For each change:

1. Search for existing utilities and helpers that could replace newly written code. Use Grep to find similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase — common locations are utility directories, shared modules, and files adjacent to the changed ones.
2. Flag any new function that duplicates existing functionality. Suggest the existing function to use instead.
3. Flag any inline logic that could use an existing utility — hand-rolled string manipulation, manual path handling, custom environment checks, ad-hoc type guards, and similar patterns are common candidates.

Note: This is a greenfield app, so focus on maximizing simplicity and don't worry about changing things to achieve it.

### Agent 2: Code Quality Review

Review the same changes for hacky patterns:

1. Redundant state: state that duplicates existing state, cached values that could be derived, observers/effects that could be direct calls
2. Parameter sprawl: adding new parameters to a function instead of generalizing or restructuring existing ones
3. Copy-paste with slight variation: near-duplicate code blocks that should be unified with a shared abstraction
4. Leaky abstractions: exposing internal details that should be encapsulated, or breaking existing abstraction boundaries
5. Stringly-typed code: using raw strings where constants, enums (string unions), or branded types already exist in the codebase

Note: This is a greenfield app, so be aggressive in optimizing quality.

### Agent 3: Efficiency Review

Review the same changes for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary work: redundant computations, repeated file reads, duplicate network/API calls, N+1 patterns
2. Missed concurrency: independent operations run sequentially when they could run in parallel
3. Hot-path bloat: new blocking work added to startup or per-request/per-render hot paths
4. Unnecessary existence checks: pre-checking file/resource existence before operating (TOCTOU anti-pattern) — operate directly and handle the error
5. Memory: unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, event listener leaks
6. Overly broad operations: reading entire files when only a portion is needed, loading all items when filtering for one

## Phase 3: Fix Issues

Wait for all three agents to complete. Aggregate their findings and fix each issue directly. If a finding is a false positive or not worth addressing, note it and move on — do not argue with the finding, just skip it.

When done, briefly summarize what was fixed (or confirm the code was already clean).
